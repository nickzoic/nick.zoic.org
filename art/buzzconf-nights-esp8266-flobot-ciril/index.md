title: 'The Internet of Toys: ESP8266, Flobot and Ciril'
---

On the 26 May I presented at [Buzzconf
Nights](https://buzzconf.io/) in Melbourne about the [ESP8266
WiFi SoC](http://esp8266.com/), its implications and how to use it.

And I got to introduce and give a quick demo of the
[Flobot](../flobot-graphical-dataflow-language-for-robots/) and
[Ciril](../ciril-cubic-inch-robots-in-labs/) projects.
