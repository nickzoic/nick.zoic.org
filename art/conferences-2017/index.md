    Conferencing continues in 2017 ... LinuxConfAU, PyConAU and perhaps YOW

title: 'Conferences in 2017 ...'

I've [talked about conferencing](/art/on-conferencing/) before and so this is
just an update for 2017.

(I've really got to work out a better way to handle these
kind of linked topics.  These pages aren't really a blog, and they aren't
really articles, they're somewhere in between.  More thought necessary!)

So far I've been to [LinuxConfAU 2017 in Hobart](/art/linuxconf-2017-hobart/) 
where I talked at the Open Hardware miniconf ... unfortunately I was unable 
to stay for the whole thing but I'll definitely be going to 
[LinuxConAU 2018 in Sydney](https://lca2018.org/) so I've got that to look 
forward to ... just got to find something amazing to talk about :-).

I'll be talking at [Melbourne Python User Group](https://wiki.python.org/moin/MelbournePUG)
about MicroPython on the 5 June, if you're interested come along!  And the
[Melbourne MicroPython Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/MicroPython-Meetup/) continues
with [Connect All The Things!](https://www.meetup.com/MicroPython-Meetup/events/239654462/) 
where we'll talk about getting your MicroPython system onto the Internet.
I'll also be at [MelbDjango](http://melbdjango.com/) at least sometimes!

I'll also be talking MicroPython at [PyConAU 2017](https://2017.pycon-au.org/) IoT 
miniconf in August, it's in Melbourne this year and well worth it if you're
interested in Python.  For companies
working in and around Python, I strongly suggest you check out the
[PyCon Australia 2017 Sponsor Prospectus](http://2017.pycon-au.org/sponsorship.pdf) 
and see if you can help out (and get your name in front of the Python community!)

And just to try it out, I've put in a proposal to [YOW Connected](http://connected.yowconference.com.au/) ... I don't know much about them but I've heard people speak highly of their other 
conferences such as [YOW Lambda Jam](http://lambdajam.yowconference.com.au/) so worth a go.

And of course I'm looking forward to [BuzzConf](https://buzzconf.io/) at the end of the year!

All this cool stuff, in and around Melbourne ... is there anything I've missed?

UPDATE:

Slides are up for [MicroPython and ESP32 at MPUG](http://nick.zoic.org/talk/mpug1/) 

I've also put a couple of proposals in for
[Developers! Developers! Developers!](https://www.dddmelbourne.com/)
so we'll see how that goes. It collided with PyCon last year but I've heard good things about it.

And I'm considering trying to find something worth saying at
[Compose Melbourne](http://www.composeconference.org/2017-melbourne/), which I went to
last year and found really fascinating, if often a little over my depth.  But I still
enjoyed it for the brain stretching exercise.
