    Conferencing continues in 2017 ... LinuxConfAU, PyConAU and perhaps YOW
tags: conference
title: 'Conferences in 2017 ...'
---

I've [talked about conferencing](/art/on-conferencing/) before and so this is
just an update for 2017.

(I've really got to work out a better way to handle these
kind of linked topics.  These pages aren't really a blog, and they aren't
really articles, they're somewhere in between.  More thought necessary!)

So far I've been to [LinuxConfAU 2017 in Hobart](/art/linuxconf-2017-hobart/) 
where I talked at the Open Hardware miniconf ... unfortunately I was unable 
to stay for the whole thing but I'll definitely be going to 
[LinuxConAU 2018 in Sydney](https://lca2018.org/) so I've got that to look 
forward to ... just got to find something amazing to talk about :-).

I'll be talking at [Melbourne Python User Group](https://wiki.python.org/moin/MelbournePUG)
about MicroPython on the 5 June, if you're interested come along!  And the
[Melbourne MicroPython Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/MicroPython-Meetup/) continues
with [Connect All The Things!](https://www.meetup.com/MicroPython-Meetup/events/239654462/) 
where we'll talk about getting your MicroPython system onto the Internet.
I'll also be at [MelbDjango](http://melbdjango.com/) at least sometimes!

I'll also be talking MicroPython at [PyConAU 2017](https://2017.pycon-au.org/) IoT 
miniconf in August, it's in Melbourne this year and well worth it if you're
interested in Python.  For companies
working in and around Python, I strongly suggest you check out the
[PyCon Australia 2017 Sponsor Prospectus](http://2017.pycon-au.org/sponsorship.pdf) 
and see if you can help out (and get your name in front of the Python community!)

And just to try it out, I've put in a proposal to [YOW Connected](http://connected.yowconference.com.au/) ... I don't know much about them but I've heard people speak highly of their other 
conferences such as [YOW Lambda Jam](http://lambdajam.yowconference.com.au/) so worth a go.

And of course I'm looking forward to [BuzzConf](https://buzzconf.io/) at the end of the year!

All this cool stuff, in and around Melbourne ... is there anything I've missed?

MORE UPDATES
============

Slides are up for [MicroPython and ESP32 at MPUG](http://nick.zoic.org/talk/mpug1/) 

I [talked about MicroPython at PyConAU 2017](/art/pycon-2017-melbourne/)!
(slides and video on that page, plus links to some other talks I found interesting)

I didn't end up getting picked to talk at 
[Developers! Developers! Developers!](https://www.dddmelbourne.com/)
(and missed out on a ticket, they sold out in minutes) but I hear it went rather well!
 
I didn't end up getting picked for 
[Compose Melbourne](http://www.composeconference.org/2017-melbourne/)
either, but I went to Compose 
last year and found really fascinating, if often a little over my depth.
So I'm heading there this year as well!

I *did* end up getting a talk into [http://connected.yowconference.com.au/](YOW! Connected),
and I'll be talking [IoT](/tag/iot/), [MicroPython](/tag/micropython/) and [ESP32](/tag/esp32/) ... okay, so the talking slots are a bit longer
than at PyCon so probably a mix of my ["Internet of (Not Shit) Things"](/art/the-internet-of-not-shit-things/)
and "MicroPython for ESP32" talks, more or less.

And in December I'll be doing [Rocket Surgery at BuzzConf](https://buzzconf.io/sessions/airborne-iot-build-a-rocket/)
along with Andy and Andrew from [CCHS](http://hackmelbourne.org/).  Come along, it'll be a hoot.

... 2018
========

I put a just plain silly number of entries in for [Linux Conf AU](https://linux.conf.au/proposals/)
which is what they get for putting the CfP deadline during PyConAU when all the ideas are bouncing around
in my head.
Hopefully something will get picked, but in any case I'll be there in Sydney 2018.

... and heading back to Sydney as well is [PyConAU 2018](https://2018.pycon-au.org/) I can hardly wait!
