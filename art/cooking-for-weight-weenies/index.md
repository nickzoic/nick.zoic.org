I've [gotten into bikepacking](/art/the-cycling-bikepacking-post/) lately,
and as well as learning some stuff about bike mechanics and working on
my fitness, I've also had to work on how to pack.

## The Weight

Weight is a funny thing.  My bike fully packed for camping weighs about
twice what it does in commuter mode, so it feels *horrible* when its 
not moving.  But all that extra weight only works out to about an extra
15% of so of the combined weight of bike + rider so once we're moving
it really doesn't make a huge difference.

There's lots of different ways to save weight but lightness costs money
so you've got to be a bit organized to work out where to save weight
economically.

| Item | Weight, g | Cost, $ |
|:---:|:---:|
|Snowpeak Titanium Splade | 15 | 15 |
|The fanciest looking full sized steel fork<br>in my kitchen cutlery drawer | 51 | 0.50 |

So, is buying titanium cutlery an economically effective way to save weight?  No.

Do I love my titanium splade anyway?  Yes.

You can spend a lot of money shaving grams off bicycle parts but generally the
best place to start is with the heaviest stuff, and one of the heaviest
parts of camping gear is cooking equipment.

## Stoves for Weight Weenies

### Gas

| Item | Weight, g |
|:---:|:---:|
|Gas Stove (mini off ebay) | 115 |
|Gas Stove (kovea moonwalker) | 354 |
|Gas Can Tripod | 32 |
|220g Gas Can (almost empty) | 174 |
|220g Gas Can (new) | 381 |
|Windshield (tall, halved) | 109 |
|Windshield (short, halved) | 52 |

There's a few interesting things to note here.

Bringing the tiny gas stove (115g) seems like it saves a fair bit of weight
over the [Kovea Moonwalker](https://koveausa.com/products/moonwalker-stove)
(354g), saving 239g but it requires a taller wind shield and
a clip-on plastic tripod for the gas canister, so the difference is only 150g,
plus the Kovea stove is better at simmering and will work at lower temperatures.

Both those stoves use isobutane fuel canisters so there's also about 180-380g
of fuel canister to carry, depending on how full it is.  
There are smaller 100g cans available but they're hard to find cheaply.

<!--Heating up a typical meal takes about 10g of gas with the tiny gas stove,
although I haven't done methodical testing here.  The Kovea is probably more
efficient too.-->

**(as an aside: you really want to use fuel cans filled with
[**Iso**butane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isobutane) and/or
[Propane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propane), because regular
[Butane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butane) stops evaporating
at around 0⁰C ... which can really cramp your cooking style on a cold morning
while you wait for the can to warm up enough for gas to come out.
If you can only find Butane and it's going to be chilly overnight it's best
to keep the can in the foot of your sleeping bag along with your microfilter!)**

### Rocket Stove

A rocket stove is really just a mechanism for burning small bits 
of wood at high temperature in copious air, resulting in highly
efficient burning.  There's a few different ways to make this work,
and I'm not sure there's a precise definition.

My one is just a cheap assembly of double-walled stainless steel tubes.
The double stainless steel walls keep a lot of heat
in and reflect radiant heat back into the center, and fresh air is drawn
in at the bottom, heated between the walls and reintroduced at the
top where it causes any wood gases to be completely burnt off,
producing [temperatures up to 300⁰C](https://www.gasparini.com/en/blog/what-is-heat-affected-zone/).

Because of the highly efficient burn you can cook dinner over scraps
of wood which would be regarded as barely adequate kindling for getting
a regular campfire started.

| | Stove | Fuel | Windshield | Legs | Total |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Mini | 115 | 300 | 109 | 32 | 556 |
| Kovea | 354 | 300 | 52 | 0 | 706 |
| Rocket | 586 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 586 |

Looking at overall weight, the rocket stove (586g) is actually lighter
than the Kovea stove plus windshield and nominal 300g gas can.
And it runs on sustainable free fuel you find laying on the ground in
every bush campsite, and gives off a cheery campfire light.

Of course, there are places and conditions where a gas stove is safe/permitted
and a rocket stove isn't, or where dry kindling is hard to find.  Plus the rocket
stove has to cool down before you can pack it up and it covers all your cookware
in soot (not as much as an open fire, but still), so it's not as clear cut as all that.

### Other kinds of stove

Hexamine (solid fuel tablet) stoves might also be worth considering for short
trips.

I should also talk about liquid fuel stoves, eg: trangia type alcohol burners
and pressurized shellite stoves, but the former I've always found horribly slow
and the latter terrifyingly erratic, but some people swear by them.

## Coffee for Weight Weenies

I do like a [decent cup of coffee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdKP6B8NkGw)
in the mornings, but also I really don't 
want to carry a whole lot of extra weight to do so.

| Item | Weight, g |
|:---:|:---:|
| Bialetti Caffetiera (stainless) | 526 |
| Wacaco Minipresso | 400 |
| Aeropress | 160 |
| Aeropress w/o pluger | 87 |
| Stainless conical filter | 10 |

On the motorcycle, I used to schlep that stainless caffettiera everywhere and it
makes a good coffee but I didn't have to pedal up hills with it.

I've used a [Minipresso](https://www.wacaco.com/products/minipresso-gr) a lot
on camping trips and at home and it makes a really excellent coffee.
The Wacaco website says it weighs 360g but I measure it as 400g, perhaps
mine is an older model.
Depending on your feelings about luxury items, it is maybe a bit heavy and fiddly for
bikepacking use.  Interestingly, they have new "smaller, lighter" models but according to
the website they're not *much* lighter.

A lighter alternative is the
[Aeropress](https://aeropress.com/products/aeropress-go-travel-coffee-press),
which is really just a robust plastic cylinder with a 
holder for a paper filter at the bottom and an airtight plunger to force
the coffee through the filter.
That's only 160g, and to be honest you might as well leave the plunger at home
and just let it drip through in its own good time.  Then it's about 87g.

Or, if we're happy to wait anyway, we can dispense with the cylinder and the
disposable paper filters and just bring the filter: a conical stainless steel
filter weighs about 10g and just sits inside your coffee cup until it's ready
and then lift it up and let it drain.

The only lighter options are "coffee bags", which I've never found to be any
good at all, and instant coffee which, well, any port in a storm but it'd better
be a hell of a storm.
