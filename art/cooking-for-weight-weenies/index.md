## Stoves for Weight Weenies

| Item | Weight, g |
|:---:|:---:|
|Gas Stove (mini off ebay) | 115 |
|Gas Stove (kovea moonwalker) | 354 |
|Gas Can Legs | 32 |
|Gas Can (almost empty) | 174 |
|Gas Can (new) | 381 |
|Windshield (tall, halved) | 109 |
|Windshield (short, halved) | 52 |
|Rocket Stove | 586 |

There's a few interesting things to note here.

Bringing the tiny gas stove (115g) seems like it saves a fair bit of weight
over the [Kovea Moonwalker](https://koveausa.com/products/moonwalker-stove)
(354g), saving 239g but it requires a taller wind shield and
some clip-on plastic legs for the gas canister, so the difference is only 150g,
plus the Kovea stove is better at simmering and will work at lower temperatures.

Both those stoves use isobutane fuel canisters which are hard to find cheaply in
the smaller sizes, so there's also about 300g in fuel canister to carry.
Heating up a typical meal takes about 10g of gas with the tiny gas stove,
although I haven't done methodical testing here.  The Kovea is probably more
efficient too.

(as an aside: you really want *ISO*butane, because butane stops evaporating
at around 0‚Å∞C, which can really cramp your cooking style on a cold morning
while you wait for the can to warm up enough for gas to come out.
If it's going to be chilly overnight it's best to keep butane cans
in the foot of your sleeping bag along with your microfilter!)

Looking at overall weight, the Kovea stove plus nominal 300g gas can is
actually heavier than my stainless steel rocket stove (586g) which runs on
sustainable free fuel you find laying on the ground in every bush campsite.
And the rocket stove gives off a cheery campfire light.

Of course, there are places and conditions where a gas stove is safe/permitted
and a rocket stove isn't, or where dry kindling is hard to find.  Plus the rocket
stove has to cool down before you can pack it up and it covers all your cookware
in soot, so it's not as clear cut as all that.

## Coffee for Weight Weenies

I do like a decent cup of coffee in the mornings, but also I really don't 
want to carry a whole lot of weight to do so.

| Item | Weight, g |
|:---:|:---:|
| Bialetti Caffetiera (stainless) | 526 |
| Wacaco Minipresso | 400 |
| Aeropress | 160 |
| Aeropress w/o pluger | 87 |
| Stainless filter | 10 |


On the motorcycle, I used to schlep that stainless caffettiera everywhere and it
makes a good coffee but I didn't have to pedal up hills.

I've used to [Minipresso](https://www.wacaco.com/products/minipresso-gr) a lot
on camping trips and at home and it makes a really excellent coffee.
The wacaco website says 360g but I measure it as 400g, perhaps mine is an older model.
Depending on your feelings about luxury items, it is maybe a bit heavy and fiddly for
bikepacking use.  Interestingly, they have new "smaller, lighter" models but according to
the website they're not much lighter.
