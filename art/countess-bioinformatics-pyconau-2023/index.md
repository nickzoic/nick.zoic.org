# Bioinformatics in 4Â½ minutes

There's a lot we don't know about genetics.
The mechanisms by which all living things live and reproduce are complex and difficult to observe directly.
Bioinformatics is the attempt to analyze these mechanisms experimentally. 

We understand a fair bit of the underlying syntax.
Our genome is split up into 23 chromosomes, each of which is a long strand of DNA.
Each chromosome contains many regions called genes, with each gene providing the instructions to make a tiny blobby machine called a protein.
When we think we know what a gene does, we give it a name.
Out of 100,000 or so genes, we've given names to about 6000 of them.

Every person's genome is different.
Some differences in genes lead to obvious, observable differences in the organism, such as hair colour or ability to digest lactose.
These tend to have a large variation in the population because they don't matter very much, or at least not in our current lives.
Because there's a big population to work with, it's possible to find correlations.
For example we know specific variants of a gene we call "LCT" lead to lactose intolerance.
  
Others lead to more subtle differences, such as your likelihood of developing specific cancers.
Because these variants are rare, and people's lives are complicated, it's much harder to find a correlation.
When a person develops cancer, it can be for a myriad of reasons. 

Nonetheless, specific genes have been identified which form part of the body's defense again cancer.
Out of hundreds of thousands of known variants of these genes we've been able to identify a few thousand particularly harmful variants.
These can result in an increased probability of developing specific cancers.
But there's a lot of variants we don't know anything about, because we've never observed them clinically.
