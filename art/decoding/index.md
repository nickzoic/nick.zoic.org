title: Decoding: Programming Beyond Text Files
---

This is a placeholder page for an article about my presentation of 
[Decoding: Programming beyond text files](https://2020.pycon.org.au/program/lyrjgy/)
at [PyCOnline AU 2020](https://2020.pycon.org.au/)

The talk is based on the article
[Programming Beyond Text Files](/art/programming-beyond-text-files)
so for now maybe go read that `:-)`
