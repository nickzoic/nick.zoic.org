I've been [messing around with my cheap ALDI 3D printer](/art/aldi-coccoon-3d-printer/)
for a few years now and it's time to upgrade!

I've put an order in for a
[Geeetech A20T](https://www.geeetech.com/geeetech-a20t-triple-color-mixing-filament-detector-breakingresuming-250x250x250mm-p-1108.html)
which has about 12Ã— the build volume of the old printer,
and has three filaments feeding into a single extuder, letting
it print designs in multiple materials and/or colours.

I'll do a separate article on
**Multi-Material 3D Printing with OpenSCAD, Cura and the Geeetech A20T**
very soon ...
