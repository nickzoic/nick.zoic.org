I've been [messing around with my cheap ALDI 3D printer](/art/aldi-coccoon-3d-printer/)
for almost five years now and it's time to upgrade!

I've put an order in for a
[Geeetech A20T](https://www.geeetech.com/geeetech-a20t-triple-color-mixing-filament-detector-breakingresuming-250x250x250mm-p-1108.html)
which has about 12Ã— the build volume of the old printer,
and has one extruder with three filaments feeding into it, letting
it print designs in multiple materials and/or colours.

This article is about setting the printer up and getting it working.
I'm writing a separate article with all the technical details of
[Multi-Material 3D Printing with OpenSCAD, Cura and the Geeetech A20T](/art/multi-material-3d-printing-openscad-cura-geeetech/)
which might be interesting if you're specifically into
[OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) and
[Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/)
but otherwise not so much.
