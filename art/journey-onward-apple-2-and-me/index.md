# Journey Onward
### the Apple 2 and me

## First Computers

Some time in the early '80s, Dad brought home an Apple 2.

![Dream 6800](img/Dream_PCB_Maggi.jpg)

It wasn't our household's first computer: that honour went to the 
"Dream 6800", a single-board computer based around the 6800
microprocessor, sporting 2K of RAM, an 18 key hexadecimal keyboard and a
stunning 64x32 monochrome pixel composite video output.
Dad built it into an old Samsonite briefcase using a keyboard
made of scavenged microswitches, with enough room
left over inside for a chunky cassette recorder.

Programs were published as long listings of hex digits which you
could type in and run. The extrememly limited resources meant that
these games generally took longer to type in than to play, and
while they could be saved to audio cassette, restoring them was
always hit and miss.

The only game I remember getting working was this
"UFO intercept" game, which was kind of like space invaders
if there were not very many invaders and they never actually
got around to invading.

## System 80

![System 80 model 3](img/hardware_s80-blue-label-front-800.jpg)
*Image: [classic-computers.org.nz/system-80](https://www.classic-computers.org.nz/system-80/hardware_s80.htm)*

The Apple 2 wasn't even our first computer with a proper keyboard:
that was the "System 80", a Dick Smith clone of the RadioShack TRS-80 Model 1.
In addition to having an actual keyboard, it featured a built in
cassette player to load and save programs from audio cassettes.

I remember spending hours colouring in graph paper to design a game
for its unusual 6 pixels per character, mixed text and 128x48
graphics display.
Never completed and sadly
lost to time now, all I can remember is it was a combination of
the only two arcade games I was really familiar with, Breakout
and Space Invaders, and it had something to do with bees.

The games are somewhat relevant to this story, the bees less so.

**1m45s**

### Apple 2

![Apple 2 Logo](img/AppleIILogo.jpg)

And then the Apple 2 arrived, and the System 80 was forgotten.

![Distracted System 80](img/distracted-system80-apple.jpg)

It was a cast-off, a cheap Apple 2 plus clone[^1], the last remaining stock
left over when a friend of Dad's decided to wind up his small import
business.  The case was built to the same moulded design as a real Apple 2 plus
but the plastic was a little mottled and swirly and slightly yellowish,
and missing the beautiful rainbow Apple logo nameplate which would
otherwise have covered the ugly injection marks on the lid moulding.

![Apple 2 Nameplate](img/Apple-II-nameplate-Howie-Shen.jpg)
*Image: [apple2history.org](https://apple2history.org/history/ah04/)*

The intellectual property laws around clones were somewhat vague at
the time, as I understand it: the circuits and physical design weren't
protected but trademarks were. The only obvious indicator that this 
was a dastardly clone was that the cheery but trademark-protected
`APPLE ][` boot message was replaced with the slightly confusing
name ` GALAGA `.

**2m30s**

Interestingly, some software[^2] would actually check that these
bytes read `APPLE ][` ... this is similar to the "DSMOS" protection
used in OS X to this day ... but we wouldn't find this out until later
when we obtained another clone, this time an ` ORANGE `.

[^2]: [including ProDOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_ProDOS#Unlicensed_Apple_II_clones)

**not sure if I'm keeping this bit**

The Apple 2 was similarly specced to the System 80: a few KB of RAM,
a BASIC interpreter, output to composite video.  The Apple 2 graphics
were somewhat better, with 280x192 "high res" graphics and colour of sorts
(although ours was always plugged into a monochrome green phosphor monitor,
so that detail escaped me for many years).

Ah, [Applesoft BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applesoft_BASIC) and the
first thrill of [programming](https://www.calormen.com/jsbasic/)

        20 GOTO 10

**3m0s**

## Apple 2 Community

But the Apple came with something else which the previous machines
had not: an active community. There was no Internet on which to
find technical information, in those days, but in addition to 
the official Apple publications
there were third party books and magazine articles.

These included the surreal ramblings of the Beagle Brothers,
which were kind of the Principia Discordia of the Apple ecosystem,
full of dense, obscure examples and strange marginalia.

A lot of this stuff is now available thanks to the
[Apple II Documentation Project](https://mirrors.apple2.org.za/Apple%20II%20Documentation%20Project/), including the 

(something about expansion slots)

## Games

Finally we were free of cassette tapes: this machine had a
Disk II controller and two 5.25" floppy drives.  Unlike 
cassettes, floppy disks could reliably store 140kB of data ...
they could even access multiple files without rewinding!
Disks opened up a whole new world of actually being able to
save stuff.

And disks we had.
In a dusty shoebox were a pile of 5.25" floppies, 
mostly single sided but with an extra notch cut into the side with
scissors. Thanks to the unusual "soft sector" design of the Apple
drives these
"[flippy disks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_II#Disk_II)"
worked pretty well, most of the time.

In the box were DOS 3.1 and 3.3 master disks, some utilities and lots and
lots of games. 

I have fond memories of very simple games like
[Apple Cider Spider](htps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Cider_Spider) and
[Conan: Hall of Volta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conan:_Hall_of_Volta),
[Choplifter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choplifter)
and [Moon Patrol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_Patrol),
all pretty simple by modern standards.

Also very confusing memories of the oddly named [The Bilestoad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bilestoad)
by the even more oddly named Mangrove Earthshoe.  Two axe-wielding warriors,
or possibly crustacea, or maybe pastries, battle it out to the tune of
*FÃ¼r Elise*, kind of.

**4m30s**

Another favourite was [Lode Runner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lode_Runner),
a really simple platformer which showed how a simple mechanic could be used
to build a fantastically complicated game.  All you can do is run, climb, dig
and fall.  Collect all the gold and an exit ladder appears.  Don't get caught
and don't get stuck.  Out of these simple parts, hundreds of official levels
were created.

Plus the game included a level editor! As you learn the tricks
and techniques you could try out your own ideas as well, and save them to disk.

# Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar

But the undisputed champion of our Apple 2 games was
[Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_IV:_Quest_of_the_Avatar),
which was not merely an ephemeral *game*, something you played for a few
minutes, before bedtime, but an *adventure*.  To conquer the game,
you had to explore, fight, and build up your resources.
You could even *save your progress* which wrote the state of the game
back to a floppy disk, so once you'd done your homework and fed
the dog you could select "Journey Onward" to continue your epic quest.

The game was so large it used *four* floppy sides, and much swapping of 
disks was required, with the game halting to demand a swap of disks whenever
your character entered a town, or left a town, or entered a dungeon,
or died in a dungeon.

You had to collect clues by talking to non-player characters in each
of the 16 castles, towns and villages scattered across the land.  Often a clue
would just be a hint about where to find some item, or who to ask for further
information, or perhaps the ingredients for a spell.
Some of these characters would be willing to join you in your quest, if
you'd acted virtuously enough, so you could build up a small party of adventurers,
very handy in battle.  

Of course, if things were going badly you could just choose not to save,
and reset the whole machine instead.  Software was simpler back then.

The game was supposed to come with various materials and an
ingenious piece of copy protection: an instruction book and a cloth map.
These were difficult to photocopy with the technology of the day,
and necessary to answer questions at a few key points in the game.
Ours, of course, being a pirate copy, had none of the above and it wasn't
like we could just
[look it up on the Internet](https://ultima.fandom.com/wiki/Ultima_IV_Locations_Map).

![Book of History](img/book-of-history.png)
*(No, really!  Read the Book of History!)*

Additionally, I was never the most *patient* or *methodical* of kids,
and so spending hours jotting down clues and beating up on skeletons and orcs
to build up enough funds for a decent sword was maaaaybe pushing it a little.

# Sector Editor

But, as it turns out, there were some more disks in the dusty shoebox,
including a *sector editor*

![sector editor](img/sector-editor.png)
*Copy II Plus Sector Editor*

> (Probably [Copy II Plus 5](https://apple2online.com/web_documents/copy_ii_plus_5.0_-_manual.pdf),
> which includes a sector editor among other things. You can find it at
> [apple2online.com](https://apple2online.com/index.php?p=1_24))

A sector editor lets you investigate and change the contents of floppy disks. 
Apple 2 disks are pretty simple.  They generally have 16 sectors x 35 tracks.
Each sector is 256 bytes, so the total floppy size is 143360 bytes (140KB).

Disks don't have to have a "file system" on them. Instead the computer
jumps to the PROM on the Disk II controller which in turn
[loads the 0th sector of the disk into memory and jumps to it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_DOS#Boot_loader)
and that tiny, 256-byte program is expected to do the rest of the work
of loading DOS.

There's lots of [details](https://apple2.org.za/gswv/a2zine/GS.WorldView/Resources/DOS.3.3.ANATOMY/BOOT.PROCESS.txt)
of these things out there: in those primitive times we were
forced to fend for ourselves with only
[Beneath Apple DOS](http://asciiexpress.net/files/docs/Beneath%20Apple%20DOS.pdf)
and a couple of
[Beagle Bros](http://beagle.applearchives.com/) tip sheets
and a mysterious glue-bound book entitled "HARDWARD MANUAL" for advice.

The Britannia disk isn't bootable, so it doesn't have to have any particular
structure, not even a boot sector.  But we knew from all that disk swapping
that that's where your progress was saved to.

And indeed if you create a new character,
and save the game, you can use your sector editor to check out the Britannia disk
and find your new character's name stored neatly at Track $14, Sector $4, Offset $04
If you're looking in a disk image file, that's offset hex 14404.

> (but note that the
> character codes in caps but offset by hex 80 and terminated by 00,

Nearby are many interesting values ... you start off the game with 300/300 HP and there's
bytes `03 00 03 00` just near your name, and the bytes `25 21 18 00` look oddly
familiar too ...

![zstats0](img/zstats0.png)
*player stats*

# Ethical Doubts

Let's try setting them to something more fun, like `99 98 97 96`, and then
restarting the game ...

![zstats1](img/zstats1.png)
*modified player stats*

OK, now we're in business.  With a bit more messing around and comparing
save games we find that there's quite a lot of things we can change in 
track 14 ...

Offset | Values | Purpose
--- | --- | ---
11416 | C7 | 'G' for good, or D0 'P' for poisoned
14417 | 25 | STR 25
14418 | 21 | DEX 21
14419 | 18 | INT 18
1441C | 03 00 | HP 0300

![zstats2](img/zstats2.png)
*more modified player stats*

Anyway, you get the idea.  The game moves along a lot quicker once you've got
99, 999 or 9999 of everything, even if the display is sometimes a little glitchy.

The "save" area isn't clearly structured and is almost certainly just a write
of the memory space used for keeping track of the status during the game.
Writing weird values here and there certainly can make a mess of the game state,
but it's pretty easy to keep backups of the Britannia disk using the sector
editor so we got stuck in.

# More Save Details

Just for fun I worked out a few more disk locations:

Offset | Values | Purpose
--- | --- | ---
14004 | 23 | Current Longitude (hex)
14005 | DE | Current Latitude (hex)
... | ... | ...
14020 | 00 00 01 86 | Number of moves made in game
... | ... | ...
14304 | 50 55 65 60 50 50 55 50 | Virtues? 3rd one probably Valor?
14314 | 02 99 | Party Food 299
14316 | ? | ?
14317 | 02 00 | Party Gold 200
... | ... | ...
1433C | 00 03 04 00 00 00 00 00 | Reagents on hand
... | ... | ...
14400 | 00 EC | ?
14402 | 00 02 | ?
11404 | CE C9 C3 CB 00 |  "NICK"
11414 | 5C | 5C for Male?
11415 | 02 | Class 2: Fighter?
11416 | C7 | C7 'G' for good, or D0 'P' for poisoned
14417 | 25 | STRength 25
14418 | 21 | DEXterity 21
14419 | 18 | INTelligence 18
1441A | 00 | MP 0 (Magic Points, I think)
1441B | 20 | Level?
1441C | 03 00 | HP 0300 Hit Points
1441E | 03 00 | HM 0300 Maximum Hit Points
14420 | 02 05 | EX 0205 Experience
14422 | 05 | Current Weapon (Axe)
14423 | 02 | Current Armour (Leather)
14424 | C9 CF CC CF 00 | "IOLO"
... | ... | ...

Names & stats for each of the other party characters follow.
By carefully experiment, you could work out what each byte means and 
how to set all party characteristics, and also the position of
ships, the balloon, etc.

# Journey Onward!

Once you have STR 99 / DEX 99 / HP 9999 and plenty of 
reagents to unpoison yourself at will it's pretty easy to get around Britannia
sweeping up monsters.

But there was still the matter of the map. We'd got hold of the Sextant by this point, 
which would give you a latitude & longitude in the format `A'B" C'D"` where each letter 
was between A and P.  That's a pretty thinly disguised pair of bytes, so we were pretty
confident that the world was:

* 256 x 256 tiles
* [toroidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wraparound_(video_games\))
* A bit obsessed with the number 16.

But how was it stored?
The hint came in the form of a rectangle of very weird ocean.  When we sailed around the 
*back* of the world, to coordinates A'A" A'A", in the middle of the deepest ocean was a
rectangle of ... random stuff.

![stuff](img/stuff.png) 
*random stuff in the map*

It didn't take too long to work out that was pretty much a 16x16 block,
taking up locations A'A" A'A" through A'P" A'P".
While the sea was sea, the monsters weren't real monsters ... just tiles. 
Indeed, as it turns out the map is stored in 16x16 regions, each taking up
one 256 byte disk sector, on the 16 sectors of the first 16 tracks of the disk.

The weird stuff in the ocean?
That was a DOS 3.3 boot sector which had been accidentally written to the
unbootable Britannia disk at some time during its pirate misadventures.

![sector map](img/sector-map.png)
*sector editor showing map-like sector*

After a while you realize that you can pretty much see the map right there in the sector
editor, with each character corresponding to a kind of tile.

> up 16 tracks out of 35, and the last few tracks are entirely blank.

# Cartomancy

Our next step was printing a map from this data.

I can't remember exactly how we did this now, but I do remember designing
7x7 1-bit icons for each of the more common map cells and writing a program
to load two sectors at a time and turn each pair into a 224 x 112 pixel image.

Hang on, why 7x7?  Well, each row of the HGR screen is 40 bytes, with
seven pixels per byte adding up to 280 pixels per row.  The eighth bit shifts
between the primary and secondary pallets, a mechanism which was
irrelevant to our dot matrix printer and utterly mysterious to us as
monochrome monitor users.  

I don't quite recall how, but somehow we then printed screenshots of these
images onto hundreds of slips of thermal printer paper, each about 10cm x 5cm.
128 of these small rectangles were then cut out and glued 
together to form a giant, if rather scruffy, map.

Sadly, the physical map and the programs used to produce it are long gone.

Years later, I used some resources found online to prduce the following 
4096x4096 pixel map.
Each map tile uses the actual 16x16 tile from the game, so the map is 
256 x 16 = 4096 pixels in each direction.

[![Britannia](img/world-thumb.jpg)](./world.html)

The towns are stored in a similar manner on the "towns" disk, with each of the 
17 town maps having a 32x32 map.  There's 17 because there's an upstairs and a downstairs
of Castle Britannia!
That disk also contains all the conversations you can have with townsfolk.

There's more of that sort of thing on [this old Ultima IV page](https://code.zoic.org/ultima/)
of mine.

# Nostalgia ain't what it used to be

Anyway, the point of this story isn't really Ultima IV.
I don't think we ever even finished the game, in any real sense.
(I suspect the only games I've ever really "finished", in the "without cheating"
sense, are Portal and the easiest difficulty of Half Life 2.)

The point is that through this process I learned too see software as observable,
mutable, fallible.
Looking at how the software behaved led to a theory of how it might be changed,
and those changes altered the game. But if you altered it too far, unexpected 
things could occur, things which the game designer never considered.

And that put me on the road I'm on today ...
