I had a fantastic time this year and learned lots from bouncing ideas
off each other. Thanks to all the organizers, workers and volunteers for
making it possible.

Functional Programming Miniconf
===============================

I was also really pleased to be part of Linuxconf's first Functional
Programming miniconf.

I presented [The Emperor's New Closure: FP in
Javascript](../the-emperors-new-closure-functional-programming-in-javascript/)
