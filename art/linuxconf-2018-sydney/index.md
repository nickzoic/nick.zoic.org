# Tutorial: Getting Started with MicroPython

I did a "Getting Started with MicroPython" tutorial at LinuxConfAU this year ...
I'd previously talked about [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) at the
[Open Hardware MiniConf](https://openhardwareconf.org/) at 
[LinuxConf](https://linux.conf.au/) 2017 and at
[/../pycon-2017-melbourne](PyConAU 2017)

* [Getting Started with MicroPython Tutorial at LinuxConfAU 2018](https://rego.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/42/)
* [Getting Started with MicroPython: Materials](https://github.com/nickzoic/mpy-tut)
* Slides: [Getting Started with MicroPython](/talk/lca2018/getting-started-with-micropython/)
* Video: [Getting Started with MicroPython (LinuxConfAU 2018)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUMgHQ62sA)

I'd like to do more with this tutorial material as time permits ...

# Open Hardware Miniconf: LoliBot

I was also peripherally involved with the Open Hardware Miniconf project.

Last year, Charlotte and I went to [NodeBots Day](https://github.com/nodebots/nodebotsday) and,
failing to follow the instructions, we made the following:

![Chipey Bot](img/chipey-bot.jpg)

It's named Chipey Bot after the chip-packet based slider on the leading edge, and uses an ESP32
and a couple of L9110S based motor drivers.  This design evolved into
[LoliBot](https://github.com/CCHS-Melbourne/LoliBot) after a whole
bunch of hard work from other people.
