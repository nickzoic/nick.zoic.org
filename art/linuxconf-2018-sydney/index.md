I talked about [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) at the
[Open Hardware MiniConf](https://openhardwareconf.org/) at 
[LinuxConf](https://linux.conf.au/) 2017 ... and now I'm off to 
LinuxConf 2018 in Sydney to present a tutorial:

projet which should be a hoot and I'm looking forward to helping out.

I'll update this page as the conference happens!
