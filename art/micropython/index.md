So I've been doing a lot of work on
[MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) lately, and talking about it at
[LinuxConf](/etc/linuxconf-2017-hobart/) and BuzzConf and
[PyConAU](/etc/pycon-2016-melbourne/).

MicroPython for ESP32
=====================

In December, I was lucky enough to score a few days' paid work getting
the [ESP32 port of
MicroPython](https://github.com/micropython/micropython-esp32) off the
ground, thanks to the generous sponsorship of
[Microbric](http://www.microbric.com) and their dedication to open
source. I'm continuing to contribute to the project [when I
can](https://github.com/nickzoic/micropython-esp32) and really enjoying
working with it.

I'm particularly enjoying the many weird peripherals built into the
ESP32 ... it's got a huge amount of stuff [right there on the
die](https://zeptobars.com/en/read/Espressif-ESP32-Wi-Fi-Bluetooth-2.4Ghz-ISM).

*UPDATE:* See also [ESP32 Capacitive
Sensors](/etc/esp32-capacitive-sensors/)

The [IoTuz](https://github.com/CCHS-Melbourne/iotuz-esp32-hardware)
project is built around the ESP32 and adds even more good stuff.

MicroPython Meetup
==================

I've also just launched a [Melbourne MicroPython
Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/MicroPython-Meetup/) to help get more
people involved. The intention is to have some hands-on workshop
sessions and some more talk-and-demo oriented sessions. Our first
meeting is scheduled, so follow along if you're interested!

Coming Up
=========

Coming up are [PyConAU 2017](https://2017.pycon-au.org/) in Melbourne
and [LinuxConfAU 2018](https://lca2018.org/) in Sydney ... I'm putting
in proposals for both of those and looking forward to talking more
MicroPython!
