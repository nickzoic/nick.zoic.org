Years ago, a personality test told me that there were
[two kinds of people](../hyper-normal/)
Process-oriented people and Goal-oriented people.

Shortly thereafter, it told me that I was the latter.
(It also told me I should become either a Mad Scientist or a Park Ranger,
so I’m not sure how much credibility to assign it.
I think it might have predated the era of Software Engineering in any case.)

Anyway, so: 3000 lines of hopefully not too awful Perl,
another 3000 lines of HTML/CSS/JS. 450 commits. 63 closed bugs
(and a bunch more little ones which never made the bugtracker, of course).
This B2B client project I’ve been working on over the last year or so has
finally finished “Phase 1″.
It’s actually out there, being marketed hard by the client and currently
being used by 250 or so customers.

Sure, it needs a bunch of stuff rewritten, refactored or just plain rethought.
There’s some infrastructure work needs doing if its going to scale to 10,000 customers.
But I’m pretty damned proud of it anyway, and its great to get to this point.

There’s 28 features currently labelled as “Phase 2″, so the job isn’t over yet …
