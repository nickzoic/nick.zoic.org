## Micro CRT

There's a bunch of ["Micro CRT"s on Ebay](https://www.ebay.com.au/sch/i.html?_nkw=micro+crt&_sacat=293),
there are a lot of different sellers but they're all pretty much the same as
[the one I bought](https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/404936807399), with a 4 inch 
[Flat CRT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube#Flat_CRTs)
tube with power supply and composite video circuitry.

The part numbers seem to be `VIS4001D`, `VIS4001EA` or `VIS4001EC`,
with some small differences between them.

## Connectors

There's a six-pin connector for brightness/contrast pots, and a 4 pin 
connector for power and composite video.  JST XH? 

## Power

The sticker on the side of the assembly says `DC12V,4.0W`.

[This tweet](https://twitter.com/ZxSpectROM/status/1408460498882940934) 
includes an infrared image of the board with the three-terminal TO220
regulator clocking in at 56.3‚Å∞C, which suggests that a
large proportion of the 4W power consumption is getting radiated from
that device alone.

By contrast, the tube itself and the "may cause mortal damage" HV power
module seem to run fairly cool.
This is good because I'll want to make a 3D printed housing for this thing
eventually.

## Displaying Composite Video

[RPi Composite Video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi#Video)

You can also get composite video out of a RPi Pico, with a bit of trickery
([1](http://www.breakintoprogram.co.uk/projects/pico/composite-video-on-the-raspberry-pi-pico),
[2](https://areed.me/posts/2021-07-14_implementing_composite_video_output_using_the_pi_picos_pio/))

## Taking Control

But what I *actually* want is to control the horizontal and the vertical
and the beam intensity separately, from a microcontroller.  This would then
let me implement a vector display.

Controlling the actual device may prove a little tricky, so let's start with
the simplest possible thing.  I already have a device which can act like a 
vector CRT ... my old [Tektronix 2225 oscilloscope](https://w140.com/tekwiki/wiki/2225),
which I pulled out of a skip at Monash Uni many years ago.

And I have any number of microcontroller boards.  The
[ESP32](/tag/esp32/) runs
[micropython](/tag/micropython/) has two 8-bit
DACs on board, so let's go with that for the moment.

There's some code up at
[github:nickzoic/mini-vector](https://github.com/nickzoic/mini-vector/)

### points

We can start off by defining an array of points to visit:

```
points = [
        (0.0, 0.0),
        (0.0, 1.0),
        (0.25, 1.0),
        (0.75, 0.5),
        (0.75, 1.0),
        (1.0, 1.0),
        (1.0, 0.0),
        (0.75, 0.0),
        (0.25, 0.5),
        (0.25, 0.0),
]
```

Here's how those points would look plotted:

[`micropython-itertools`](https://pypi.org/project/micropython-itertools/)
implements a lot of the core python `itertools`, including a handy function `cycle`
which repeats an iterable indefinitely, so `cycle(points)` runs through all the points
in an endless loop.

If you don't have `itertools` installed you can always define this function yourself:

```
def cycle(iterable):
    while True:
        yield from iterable
```

### segments

At this point, I wanted to loop over each line segment.
Unfortunately, it doesn't include `pairwise`, so I had to implement that myself:

```
from itertools import cycle

def pairwise(iterable):
    it = iter(iterable)
    a = next(it)
    for b in it:
        yield a, b
        a = b
```

now we can easily step through the line segments like this:

```
for (x1, y1), (x2, y2) in pairwise(cycle(points)):
    print (x1, y1, x2, y2)
```

now we've got each line segment, what are we going to do with it?
Let's try breaking it up into a number of intermediate points,

```
steps = 8

for (x1, y1), (x2, y2) in pairwise(cycle(points)):
    for s in range(0,steps):
        f = s / steps
        x = x1 * (1-f) + x2 * f
        y = x1 * (1-f) + y2 * f
        print(x,y)
```

### intensity
