## Vector Displays

## Micro CRT

There's a bunch of ["Micro CRT"s on Ebay](https://www.ebay.com.au/sch/i.html?_nkw=micro+crt&_sacat=293),
there are a lot of different sellers but they're all pretty much the same as
[the one I bought](https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/404936807399), with a 4 inch 
[Flat CRT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube#Flat_CRTs)
tube with power supply and composite video circuitry.

The part numbers seem to be `VIS4001D`, `VIS4001EA` or `VIS4001EC`,
with some small differences between them.

By a curious coincidence I spotted one of these in the wild!

Note that unlike the phosphor surface on a normal CRT which has phosphor
on the front, with this device you're looking right through the tube to
the phosphor on the back side.

## Connectors

There's a six-pin connector for brightness/contrast pots, and a 4 pin 
connector for power and composite video.  JST XH? 

## Power

The sticker on the side of the assembly says `DC12V,4.0W`.

[This tweet](https://twitter.com/ZxSpectROM/status/1408460498882940934) 
includes an infrared image of the board with the three-terminal TO220
regulator clocking in at 56.3‚Å∞C, which suggests that a
large proportion of the 4W power consumption is getting radiated from
that device alone.

By contrast, the tube itself and the "may cause mortal damage" HV power
module seem to run fairly cool.
This is good because I'll want to make a 3D printed housing for this thing
eventually.

## Displaying Composite Video

[RPi Composite Video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi#Video)

You can also get composite video out of a RPi Pico, with a bit of trickery

## Taking Control

But what I *actually* want is to control the horizontal and the vertical
and the beam intensity separately, from a microcontroller.  This would then
let me implement a vector display.
