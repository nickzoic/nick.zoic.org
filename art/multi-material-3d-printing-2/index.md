## Mixing

I'm beginning to think I'd be better off with a
[Reprap Diamond](https://reprap.org/wiki/Diamond_Hotend) style
printhead which looks like it has a much smaller internal "mixed" volume,
or maybe just give up and go with
[three separate nozzles](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32887495430.html)
after all.

Altering the printer so radically might sound a bit crazy but it'd
actually be a fairly simple upgrade I think, so long as you don't mind
having the three nozzles share a heater and thermostat.

Of course, something in my tiny brain is telling me: if you can't decide
between 3 individual nozzles and one three-way mixing nozzle, perhaps you
need a two-way mixing nozzle plus another separate nozzle ... or two
two-way mixing nozzles!  The possibilities are endless.
This way, clearly, lies madness.
