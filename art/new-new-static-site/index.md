Shifting
========

It seems just the other day I [shifted this blog to Pelican and S3](/art/new-static-site/)
but apparently it has been almost 4 years.

Now we're shifting over to running on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) /
[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) ... it seems easier.

Some things are still a bit borken, but I'm slowly cleaning them up.

UPDATE: This turned out to be a bit epic, due to some mistakes in the way internal links
were converted, and link rot on the external resources turned out to be a huge problem.
Still, [LinkChecker](https://wummel.github.io/linkchecker/) finally returns without errors,
so hopefully most of the links are meaningful again.

Theme
=====

I didn't really like the way a lot of the Jekyll stuff worked out of the box, so
I've reimplmented some of the smaller wheels and kept some of the styling from the
old site, and here it is!

The wallpaper is from: [Subtle Patterns](http://subtlepatterns.com/3px-tile/).

"Bitter" and "Source Sans Pro" font suggestion thanks to: [inSquare
Media](http://www.insquaremedia.com/).

HTTPS
=====

I'm hoping to finally upgrade the site to HTTPS ... it is already available at 
https://nickzoic.github.io/ but I'd
[like the certificate to work for the custom domain as well](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/156)
