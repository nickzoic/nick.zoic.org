Back in June 2020, I started writing this article:

That's as far as I got before giving up in the face of the futility of it all.
It really has been an odd year though, these last 3 years.

I've done a few things.  No [in person conferences](/art/on-conferencing/) but 
I did make video presentations about some historical computing stuff at
[PycOnline 2020](/art/decoding-the-making-of/) and [EveryWorld 2020](/art/journey-onward-apple-2-and-me/)
which was fun but also incredibly time-consuming and somehow ... hollow?
I think by that time I was very much burnt out from online communications.

I started [writing a game (sort of)](/art/writing-an-apple-2-game-in-2021-1/) and I
[made a MIDI guitar (sort of)](/art/midi-hero/) and I
[upset a lot of people](/art/qr-codes-advice/) and did a bit of 
[3d printing](/tag/3dprint/) but otherwise, despite a massive amount
of time on my hands, I didn't get a whole lot done.

Offline, I did learn a bit of Ukulele, but part of the joy of that is that's it's an Entirely Offline Hobby,
I even print out sheet music for myself on paper so I can enjoy the total absence of onlineyness, so
I won't be ruining it for myself by writing about it here
([much](/art/3d-printed-ukulele-bridge-saddle-pla/)) â€” although it has given me the opportunity to
experience just how offputting it is to beginners to describe any new skill as "easy"!

And I've done a lot of cycling, which I probably [will write about](/tag/cycling/)
at some point.
Like just about everyone, I did eventually catch COVID, and despite a whole bunch of 
vaccinations it was not a whole bundle of laughs,
but over the year I've recovered well and I'm back to cycling again and 
building my fitness back up so hoping to do a lot of riding this summer.

I'm now working on [CountESS](/art/attack-and-dethrone-excel) pretty much full time and 
looking forward to talking about it (and the MIDI guitar) at my first in-person conference
in several years, [PyConAU Adelaide](/art/pycon-pyconau-2023-adelaide/).  Hope to see you there.
