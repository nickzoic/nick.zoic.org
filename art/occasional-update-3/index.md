At the time of the [last update](../occasional-update-2/)
I'd just started working on 
[CountESS](https://github.com/CountESS-Project/CountESS/)
and was looking forward to
[talking about it at PyConAU](../pycon-pyconau-2023-adelaide/)
which was fun but also proved to be quite overwhelming:
I haven't been around that many people in a long time!
