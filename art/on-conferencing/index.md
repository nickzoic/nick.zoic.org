So far in 2016 I've been to [LinuxConf](https://linux.conf.au/),
[PyConAU](https://2016.pycon-au.org/) and
[Compose](http://composeconference.org), and if it hadn't been the same
weekend as PyCon I'd have gone to [DDD](https://dddmelbourne.com/) as
well. I've also been along to plenty of smaller meetups including
[MelbDjango](http://melbdjango.com/) and [BuzzConf
Nights](https://buzzconf.io). So why all this relentless conferencing?

Well, for starters, I enjoy sharing the stuff I'm working on with
others, whether that's as an official talk or a BoF session or just
chatting in the "hallway track" or coming up with [bad ideas in
bars](../squawk-cc-the-true-story/). It's always tempting to hide your
ideas away until they're "ready", but getting them [out and in front of
people](../flobot-graphical-dataflow-language-for-robots/) is a great
way to put them to the test and see what other people think. And even if
what you're doing isn't really breaking new ground, it's great to [share
what you've
learnt](../the-emperors-new-closure-functional-programming-in-javascript/)
about what works for you and give that back to the community.

Obviously, there's also networking -- conferences are a great way to
meet people and get to know what's going on in the industry. There's no
point going along with the attitude that this is your chance to make
that connection and make it big ... that's not really how it works. But
making friends "In Real Life" is a great way to feel part of a community
and avoid feeling isolated and besieged by
[trolls](http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/19): also a great way
to remind yourself not to become one! And you never know ... sometimes
very cool opportunities do come up!

It's not just about talking though: you've also got to listen. There's
always a huge variety of things on offer at these conferences, which
means they add up to more than the sum of their parts: I find myself
[making connections between seemingly unrelated
talks](../cqrs-for-blue-green-deployment/) and
who knows: some day one of those connections may turn out to be
fruitful! Computing in particular has a long tradition of recycling:
there is little that is [startlingly
original](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos) but
instead a slow iterative evolution of ideas. The more you expose
yourself to new stuff, the more chance you have to be part of that
evolution! Having a wide range of ideas to draw upon is a great asset as
a consultant.

But I think the most valuable presentations are those which are alien to
you. There's always a risk of becoming an "[expert
beginner](http://www.daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/)",
especially as a consultant or a contractor. Learning about something
outside your experience is a great way to remind yourself of the value
of the "[Beginner's Mind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin)", to
knock yourself out of a mental rut and remind yourself that it is okay
to not know everything, or to understand everything the first time.

So yes: I go to a lot of these things! It's a big investment of time
(especially if you're talking), but it is also a great opportunity to
talk, listen, and grow as a professional.
