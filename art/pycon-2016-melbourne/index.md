title: PyCon 2016 Melbourne
---

[PyCon 2016](https://2016.pycon-au.org/) is in Melbourne, and so am I!

> "Two days in! One to go! Exhausted! Overcaffeinated! Can barely speak!
> Why not do a lightning talk!?" -- me, this morning.

Last weekend was PyCon AU ... it seems like a long time ago already! It
was a great weekend, lots of energy and heaps to think about.

There's videos appearing now on the [PyCon AU Youtube
Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/PyConAU/videos) and I'll add some
notes on other people's presentations I found interesting as I get
around to it.

I did a couple of talks at the IoT miniconf this year, plus a lightning
talk on Sunday.

IoT Miniconf: ESP and MicroPython
=================================

-   [ESP8266 and
    Micropython (Slides)](../../talk/pycon2016/esp8266-and-micropython/)
-   [ESP8266 and
    Micropython (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C19fFU-TVWU)

I'd previously talked about some of this stuff at Buzzconf Nights:

-   [The Internet of Toys](../buzzconf-nights-esp8266-flobot-ciril/)

IoT Miniconf: The Internet of (Better) Things
=============================================

-   [The Internet of (Better)
    Things (Slides)](/../../talk/pycon2016/internet-of-not-shit-things/)
-   [The Internet of (Better)
    Things (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcXMZOuU0HA)

This was based on a blog post:

-   [The Internet of Not Shit
    Things](../the-internet-of-not-shit-things/)

I think the Miniconf went very well and I believe we'll be doing it
again next year. Hopefully I'll have lots more fun things to talk about!

Lightning Talk: Flobot
======================

Several people asked about this after the Micropython talk, so ...

-   [Flobot Lightning
    Talk (Slides)](../../talk/pycon2016/flobot-visual-programming/)
-   [Flobot Lightning
    Talk (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgbZInw6rNM#t=2m20s)

I ran out of time to mention that I'm in the process of converting
flobot from C to [MicroPython](http://micropython.org) and that the
entire thing is MIT licensed.

There's heaps more stuff about Flobot:

-   [Flobot original blog
    post](../flobot-graphical-dataflow-language-for-robots/)
-   [Flobot continued](../flobot-continued/)
-   [Flobot on Github](https://github.com/mnemote/flobot/)

I also discuss and demo in \* [The Internet of
Toys](../buzzconf-nights-esp8266-flobot-ciril/)

The little prototype robot I demoed with is called Ciril. I've also been
working on getting Flobot to work on an ESP chip riding on top of an
[mBot](http://www.makeblock.cc/mbot/) platform, which I'll write up the
details of some time soon.

-   [Ciril on Github](https://github.com/mnemote/ciril/)

I got even more interest in Flobot after the talk, so I'm hoping that it
won't be too long before it gets in front of a much wider audience.

Other People's Talks
====================

-   [Damien George's
    Keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm08hXeuv-I) is all about
    MicroPython, Kickstarter and the amazing places MicroPython has
    gone. [Damien's IoT
    keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNo7kRHyubg) was also a
    tough act to follow.
-   [Jim Mussared also talked about MicroPython (and the BBC Microbit,
    and the ESP8266)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCEZyJqkMrE), over
    in the Education miniconf. There was a heap of stuff I wanted to see
    in that miniconf, but couldn't get there because I was pretty busy
    in the IoT one. So now I'm now going to watch it all on video!
-   [James Stewart talked about
    OpenGB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgvnPB_77z8) for controlling
    3D printers in a friendlier, happier way. Also, the Python Stave!

So what's next?
===============

-   I'll be at [BuzzConf](http://buzzconf.io/) this year and maybe
    mucking around with ESP8266 and Flobot there.
-   I'd love to have more people involved in these projects! If you
    don't know how you could contribute, get in touch!
