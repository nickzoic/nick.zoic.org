# Sprinting on MicroPython / ESP32

About 100 people attended the Monday sprints, with about 20 working on MicroPython / ESP32 
related topics.  Thanks to sponsorship from [Espressif](https://espressif.com/) we were able to 
give away a whole bunch of ESP32 DevKitCs to attendees interested in working on the port.

If you're in Melbourne and interested in doing further work on MicroPython in a friendly
and supportive environment, check out the
