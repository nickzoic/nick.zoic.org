title: 'Talking MicroPython at PyConAU 2017 ...'
---

I've just finished up at [PyCon2017](https://2017.pycon-au.org), where I talked about
[MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) ... there's over 700 delegates here talking about a whole
range of stuff Python and otherwise ...

[As always](/art/on-conferencing/) I learned a lot and really enjoyed bouncing ideas off 
other ideas.  

# MicroPython on ESP32

I talk about where the ESP32 port of MicroPython is at, and why I think it is particularly 
interesting, and shamelessly plug the sprint and meetup group.

# OMNICODE!

A lightning talk on a rather silly idea.

# Other People's Talks

Huge number of videos up here: [PyConAu 2017 on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLs4CJRBY5F1KsK4AbFaPsUT8X8iXc7X84)

Some fairly arbitrary choices of things which grabbed me:

* [Tim 'mithro' Ansell "Using Python For Creating Hardware To Record FOSS Conferences"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdLiI-XLTcI)
* [Damien George "Using MicroPython in the wild"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI-nTf5iM84)
* [Anna Gerber "Progam all the things!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Uw1UW0_nHE)
* [Peter Hall "A Brief History of 'What is the Time?'"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJmx0tcVubY&start=3217)
* [Alexis Lucattini "Remote DNA Sequencing and Analysis"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXDEycbWgqE)
* [Katie McLaughlin "How to handle abandoned projects, Take Two" (keynote)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prFaJugC95Y)
* [Andreas Moll "Lightflow"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTNPpeA1lbo)
* [Jim Mussared "Tuning in with SDR & Python"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlJSjRDSLu0)
* [Aurynn Shaw "When Do We Belong?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RWBRrHxEhs)

# Sprinting on MicroPython / ESP32

About 100 people attended the Monday sprints, with about 20 working on MicroPython / ESP32 
related topics.  Thanks to sponsorship from [Espressif](https://espressif.com/) we were able to 
give away a whole bunch of ESP32 DevKitCs to attendees interested in working on the port.

If you're in Melbourne and interested in doing further work on MicroPython in a friendly
and supportive environment, check out the
