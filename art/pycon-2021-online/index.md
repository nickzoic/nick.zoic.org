[PyConAU 2021 was online again](https://2021.pycon.org.au/)
due to The Great Unpleasantness.  I didn't [talk this year](/art/decoding-programming-beyond-text-files/) and
only had time to see a few talks so this is just a round-up of
some subjective highlights.  I'll add links once the videos are up on the
[PyConAU channel on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLs4CJRBY5F1LKN2ISCse415LW5FZEjDX2) and probably add a few more talks too!

## Composing Algorithmic (Notated) Music with Python and Abjad (Tsz Kui Pang)

This was an interesting talk about music, but the main thing I found interesting was move from
"software" to "notation" to "programming".
[Abjad](https://abjad.github.io/) lets you programmatically generate music
notation much like [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org) does for 3D models and 
[SKIDL](https://github.com/xesscorp/skidl) does for electronics design.

Tsz Kui generates a number some interesting but difficult looking scores 
algorithmically ... 
[this monstrosity](https://socks-studio.com/2012/05/19/the-unplayable-score-faeries-aire-and-death-waltz-john-stump/) also came up in the discssion :-)

## Snakes all the way down, building Worlds with Python code (Sam Bishop)

This was fascinating and as always something new popped up:
[Wave Function Collapse](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse)
as very well explained [here by Robert Heaton](https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/17/wavefunction-collapse-algorithm/)
this looks very cool and I'm looking forward to playing with it.

## Setting up a machine translation service for Timor Leste (RaphaÃ«l Merx, Mel Mistica)

This talk is about the challenges of setting up [tetun.org](https://tetun.org/) which provides
machine translation of Tetun, the lingua franca of [Timor Leste](https://www.timorleste.tl/).
Tetun is little known langugage to the rest of the world, with only 1.3 M speaker so there's little
data to work from and it's far too small to attract the attention of projects like Google Translate.
