This is just a quick post to let you know I'll be at
[PyConAU 2023 Adelaide](https://2023.pycon.org.au/)
talking about
[CountESS](https://github.com/CountESS-Project/CountESS/)
and also presenting 
[my lame MIDI Guitar](/art/midi-hero/)
at the inaugural PyConAU Fair!

This will be my first in-person conference since
[PyConAU and Compose Melbourne in 2018](https://nick.zoic.org/art/pycon-2018-sydney/)
so I'm very excited and I hope you can come along too.

I'll add more info here closer to the event ...
