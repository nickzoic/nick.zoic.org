title: 'PyConAU 2023 Adelaide!'
---

This is just a quick post to let you know I'm at
[PyConAU 2023 Adelaide](https://2023.pycon.org.au/)
I'll add some more stuff later.

This is my first in-person conference since
[PyConAU and Compose Melbourne in 2018](https://nick.zoic.org/art/pycon-2018-sydney/)
so I'm very excited ...


## CountESS

* [Slides from "CountESS: Count-based Experimental Scoring and Statistics"](/talk/pycon2023/countess/)
* [Video at YouTube](http://youtu.be/JzU6cbvZ0a0)
* [countess github repo](https://github.com/CountESS-Project/CountESS/)

**ERRATA: I somehow got [Frederick Sanger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Sanger)'s
name wrong in the slides and just read it out without noticing. Ooops. Hopefully I'll be able to 
put a correction in the video.  Sorry, Fred.**

## MIDI Hero

... at the inaugural PyConAU Fair!

* [MIDI Hero blogpost 1](/art/midi-hero/)
* [MIDI Hero blogpost 2](/art/midi-hero-2/)

There's some video from the fair itself including me making boop boop noises
but not very muscially.  On of these days I'll fix the terrible latency on
this device and it'll be actually fun to play.

## Other Videos

The videos are now appearing on [the PyConAU YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@PyConAU)
(here's the [2023 playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLs4CJRBY5F1KwxIxbTmhN9jX4hBtE-OKJ))
and so far ones that I've found interesting:

### Bio sciences

* [Alan Rubin: Building a biological database with Python](https://youtu.be/uy7FEXW9onE)

  This is all about MaveDB, which is somewhat related to CountESS in that it deals with MAVEs.

* [David Lawrence: Analysing and sharing genetic data with Python](https://youtu.be/vmQ1_Pzh4Us)

### Other science stuff

* [Alex Ware: An Introduction to PySpark](https://youtu.be/ZFLOMSuWHxg)

* [Andrew Williams: Using Python and 19,200 bits/second serial links to manage antennae for the Square Kilometre Array](https://youtu.be/tYP6nypJWtY)

  The number 19,200 will apparently haunt me always.  It's interesting to see the lengths that this
  team have had to go to to avoid radio interference.

### Other

* [Russell Keith-Magee: How to build a cross-platform graphical user interface with Python](https://youtu.be/vmQ1_Pzh4Us)

  All about Toga, which is a nice GUI toolkit alternative to ... well, all the other ones.
  CountESS's GUI should probably be rewritten in Toga.

* [Amanda J Hogan: Zero or Hero? Assessing Pygame Zero in the classroom](https://youtu.be/g5Tw1sYzXg0)

  Amanda brings some perspective on what it's like to teach beginner programmers, which I think 
  is really interesting as we're all begineers from time to time.

### WASM, etc

Yeah, I'm [still interested in WASM](/art/web-assembly-on-esp32-with-wasm-wamr/) for many reasons,
not the least of which is that I'm sick of hearing about containers.  Katie's & Jim's talks are
somewhat connected so watch Katie's first ...

* [Katie Bell: What can't WebAssembly do?](https://youtu.be/JbZAsSzzk0E)

* [Jim Mussared: WASM in your wheel](https://youtu.be/yVA4TUtTDks)

### More

There's heaps more I haven't watched yet so I'll update this page as I do ...
