title: 'PyConAU 2025 Melbourne - The Primordial Code'
---

I'm at [PyConAU 2025 Melbourne](https://2025.pycon.org.au/)
... last year I didn't speak but I did some session chair duty 
as a [volunteer](https://2024.pycon.org.au/attend/volunteer/) which
was also interesting and a peek below the serene surface to the madly
paddling feet of the PyConAU swan.  Or something like that.

## The Primordial Code

[I spoke about my bioinformatics work in 2023](../pycon-pyconau-2023-adelaide/)
but this is a talk about the eerie parallels between computer architecture
and life as we know it ...

## Other People's Talks Which I Found Particularly Interesting

I did a lot of hallway tracking but there were some interesting
presentations ... I'll add some stuff here once everyone's video links are up.
