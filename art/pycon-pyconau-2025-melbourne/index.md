---

I'm at [PyConAU 2025 Melbourne](https://2025.pycon.org.au/)
... last year I didn't speak but I did some session chair duty 
as a [volunteer](https://2024.pycon.org.au/attend/volunteer/) which
was also interesting and a peek below the serene surface to the madly
paddling feet of the PyConAU swan.  Or something like that.

The videos get shared on Youtube but it's not always obvious how to
get back here.  If you've got questions, please get in touch.

## The Primordial Code

[I spoke about my bioinformatics work in 2023](../pycon-pyconau-2023-adelaide/)
but this is a talk about the eerie parallels between computer architecture
and life as we know it ...

(PS: someone always asks me about my [python 3 confirmed t-shirt](/art/python-3-confirmed/)
which I realize I've worn to a very large number of conference talks now!)
