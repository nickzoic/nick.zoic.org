I'll be at [PyConAU 2025 Melbourne](https://2025.pycon.org.au/)
... last year I didn't speak but I some session chair duty 
as a [volunteer](https://2024.pycon.org.au/attend/volunteer/) which
was also interesting and a peek below the serene surface to the madly
paddling feet of the PyConAU swan.  Or something like that.

## The Primordial Code

[I spoke about my bioinformatics work in 2023](../pycon-pyconau-2023-adelaide/)
and the more I learn about biology the more I enjoy it.

This is a talk about the eerie parallels between computer architecture and
the multi-billion-year-old operating system that runs all life as we know it.

This page will expand to include my slides and also comments on 
other presentations when the conference is underway ...
