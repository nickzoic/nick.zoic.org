I'm at [PyConAU 2025 Melbourne](https://2025.pycon.org.au/)
... last year I didn't speak but I did some session chair duty 
as a [volunteer](https://2024.pycon.org.au/attend/volunteer/) which
was also interesting and a peek below the serene surface to the madly
paddling feet of the PyConAU swan.  Or something like that.

## The Primordial Code

[I spoke about my bioinformatics work in 2023](../pycon-pyconau-2023-adelaide/)
but this is a talk about the eerie parallels between computer architecture
and life as we know it ...

I'll post a video once they're up but the above link gives you the slides plus
my speaker notes which I'll amend if and when I get around to it.

## Other People's Talks Which I Found Particularly Interesting

So far I've mostly been hallway tracking but there have been some interesting
presentations ... I'll add some stuff here once the video links are up.
