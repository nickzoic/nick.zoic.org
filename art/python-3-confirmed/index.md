So a couple of people have asked about the T-shirt I'm wearing in 
[my MicroPython / ESP32 talk at PyConAU 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N1hNRDkm0o)

*Me at PyConAU 2017*

I had the idea a while ago while procrastinating instead of making
conference slides: it's a mashup of
[the Python logo](https://www.python.org/community/logos/) and the
[Half-Life 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_2) logo.

# Licensing

About the logo, the PSF says:

> Making your own shirts is OK too, but please seek permission from
> the PSF if you are planning to sell merchandise that shows the Python logo.

Hopefully [Valve](https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/) won't mind the one
little bit of their logo given it is not used in a way likely to cause confusion.
It's probably covered by Australian fair-use law, but anyway, Valve folks,
if you're reading this can you please just 
[get on with Half Life 3?](https://www.techradar.com/au/news/gaming/half-life-3-release-date-news-and-rumours-1290663)
Or [Portal 3](https://www.looper.com/48490/valve-wont-make-portal-3/)
that'd be cool too.

Anyway, in so far as this design has any legal existence beyond that
of the source materials, it is released under the
[CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)
license.  Go print your own!

# Printing

The one in the video is printed by [Print Locker](https://printlocker.com.au/) on a
"GILDAN Adult Ultra Cotton Tee (Chocolate)"
and I'm very happy with the print quality: it's been worn a lot with
very little wear.

# Download

Here it is as a 2280 x 1730 PNG bitmap, which is plenty big enough to
print a T-shirt at 150+ dpi.  It isn't aliased so you can bucket-fill
it to whatever colours and fills you like.

*Python 3 Confirmed!*

Sorry, I don't have a vector version, although I'm thinking of 
making one just so I can [/tag/3dprint](3D print) it as well ...
