In totally not work related news, I've been working
on set design and construction for 
[Diamond Valley Singers](https://www.dvsingers.org/)'s 
production of
[Seussical Jr.](https://www.dvsingers.org/seussical-junior)

This has been a really mind-blowing experience and it's been
great to be doing something so disconnected from my normal
life of computing.

Still, there's a lot in common with software development:
having a big vision is important, but also you need to be
able to execute on the small details.
Some things which seem difficult turn out
to work first time and other things turn out to be way harder 
than they reasonably should.
Everything has a weird name.
And like software development, it's very much a team effort
and every contribution counts.

This has meant making things like a 13m x 6m circus curtain
(with [Kabuki](https://paperclip.rcs.ac.uk/index.php/Kabuki_Drop)
[Drop](https://magickabukidrop.com/manual-kabuki-drop-systems/))
and a levitating 2.1m tall "cat in the hat" hat from which
the Cat can appear ...

It's on stage now, some kind reviews are coming in,
everything seems to be running smoothly, our junior
performers are doing a fantastic job
and in another week it'll be a fading memory ...
