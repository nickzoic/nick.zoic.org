# Cognitive Limits and the Social Network

So, in general, humans are assumed to have a
[cognitive limit to the number of social connections, aka Dunbar's Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number),
of about 100-250 people, the usual number bandied about is
[150](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26189988/).
This isn't a limit to the number of people you casually "know", it's the limit to the
number of people you're able to keep up social contact with and actually remember something
about.

150 is a large number of people to interact with in real life, but it's quite a small number
in Internet Social Networking terms.
Especially younger people may be enthusiastic participants
in several different social networks, and have different but overlapping social circles on
different platforms.
Sometimes, the same person will have different usernames and/or avatars
on different platforms, adding to the confusion.

It wouldn't be unusual for a person to have several hundred contacts in total,
growing all the time and well and truly exceeding Dunbar's number.
This suggests that it is impossible for mere humans to keep track of all these relationships
mentally, and that either young people are going to have to start using
[CRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management)
software to remind them who is who.
