## Pre-history

As a kid I rode bikes.  I mean, everyone did.  We lived in a very hilly suburb though so mostly
we didn't ride at home, we rode when we were down at Philip Island, since that's almost entirely
flat.  I never really had a decent bike though until when I was at Uni I went and bought a shiny
new Shogun Metro to get around on, and despite also having various cars and motorcycles I kept
the pushie handy and used to commute from Fitzroy to the city on it fairly regularly.  Zipping
around the inner suburbs on two wheels was always a joy.

Then I got married and moved to a hilly suburb and the bike gathered cobwebs for many years.
More motorcycles came and went, a couple of kids came along and we wobbled around the park on
our bikes a bit, but I never really rode it much.

But then: I was working for a client where a lot of the staff rode to work every day, and one
of those Ride To Work Day things was happening, and in a fit of bravado I declared I was going
to dust the bike off and ride in for it.  Well, not all the way from Watsonia to Fitzroy, I'd
catch the train most of the way, but still, that counted, right?

That first morning was a disaster, the brain may not forget how to ride a bicycle but the 
muscles sure do and I was barely a kilometer from home when I ran out of puff and almost threw
up my breakfast. I was tempted to abandon the bike but I hadn't brought a lock or anything
and rather than leave it to the wolves I pushed it up the remaining hill and down to the station.

The train commute in gave me time to catch my breath, and rolling off at Clifton Hill I felt a
renewed willingness to give it a go.  Also, it was gently downhill all the way to Fitzroy.
So I got back in the saddle and zigged and zagged my way slowly across the familiar Fitzroy grid,
feeling like a bit of a fraud, but I got a free breakfast anyway.

I got the train home and the bike stayed locked up at work for a couple of days until I found
the energy to roll down to Victoria Park station and the train home.  In retrospect, I decided I'd
quite enjoyed *parts* of this process, and so over the next few weeks I did this same thing a
few more times: bike and train in, walk and train home, the opposite the next day.  Eventually I
was riding to and from the station more often than walking or taking the tram.

And then one fateful morning, maybe I'd just missed a train at Watsonia, maybe the weather was
especially beautiful, I don't remember, but instead of getting off the bike at Watsonia I kept 
going to Macleod, and got the train from there.  And then at some point I leapfrogged 
Macleod and went to Rosanna.  And one day I jumped off at Dennis instead of waiting for Clifton
Hill.  Before I knew it, I was riding at least half way fairly regularly and before too
long I was working out how to follow the Darebin Creek Trail and even starting to enjoy it.

The train was still there as a backup when the weather was too hot or too cold or I just 
couldn't be bothered, but I'd somehow transitioned from occasional recreational wobbler to 
committed commuter.

## Commuting Life

After a couple of years on the red rattler, I decided it was time to upgrade.  I was pretty 
sure I knew what I wanted: alloy frame, carbon forks, disc brakes and a whole lot of gears 
for the Watsonia hills.  If I was smarter I would have searched for a bargain on gumtree or
whatever but instead I just walked into Ivanhoe Cycles, the same shop which had sold me that
Shogun Metro a couple of decades earlier.  I test rode a bunch of things including a carbon
racer which cost more than my car and weighed less than my wallet, but in the end I decided
on a Giant Cross City 1, which ticked all the boxes and also (in case you think I'm being
entirely rational here) had a very nice color scheme going on.

I didn't really change the bike at all during this time, other than fitting a very
basic rack and upgrading the tyres from the stock 32mm tyres (which I found quite
squirrelly on crushed gravel trails) to 38mm Schwalbe Marathons
which were much nicer.  Mostly I just commuted on the Darebin Creek, Main Yarra and
Merri Creek trails, and also poked my nose into the more accessible bits of
Plenty Gorge from time to time.

## The Great Unpleasantness

And then in 2020, COVID struck and Melbourne was plunged into a series of lockdowns
of various levels of pointlessness.  The bike proved an essential mental health
measure, and just about every day I'd jump on and try to find a new way to get to
the 5km limit and back.  A lot of the time that meant heading over into 
Plenty Gorge and I reckon I rode, or at least pushed the bike along, every trail 
in the southern part of the gorge at one time or another.

## Going for Distance

Once the more ridiculous restrictions were lifted I got around to installing
[Ride with GPS](https://ridewithgps.com/), recording a few rides and starting
to make some plans.  One thing in particular had leapt out at me: 

    Watsonia -> Darebin Creek Trail -> Main Yarra Trail ->
    Mullum Mullum Creek Trail -> Eastlink Trail ->
    Dandenong Creek Trail -> Carrum

That's right, I could ride all the way to the beach, 99% on bike trails.
76km was further than I'd ridden before, but ... I could get the train back
home from Carrum, and if anything went wrong there were plenty of train
stations to provide a 'crap out' option.

And after a couple of false starts, in November 2021, I finally did it!
One trail merged into another and before I knew it I was crossing the 
footbridge over the Maroondah Highway, the highest point of my trip.
And then down to the empty beach at Carrum for a swim!

I've done some other long loops but it's just such a nice ride, and
jumping into the water at the end is so damned refreshing.  I've
done Westerfolds to Carrum and back a couple of times, which is about 
120km and cuts out the annoying last hills up into Darebin.

Now my ambition is the crack the ton, 100 miles (161km) in a day.
Perhaps I should go somewhere a lot flatter to try it out.

Another highlight was riding up Mt Donna Buang, starting from
Healesville and going up, over then back via the O'Shannassy 
Aqueduct Trail and Panton's Gap.  A very big day but well worth it.

## Bikepacking

I used to do a fair bit of solo travel by [motorcycle](https://moto.zoic.org/)
and while I've got rid of all my old bikes now I do kind of miss it.
So I've started working towards Bikepacking!
