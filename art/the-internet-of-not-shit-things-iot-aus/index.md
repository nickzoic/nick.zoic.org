at IoT Aus
==========

I presented my [The Internet of (Not Shit)
Things](/etc/the-internet-of-not-shit-things/) talk from [PyCon
2016](/etc/pycon-2016-melbourne/) tonight at an [IoT Australia
Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/InternetOfThingsAustralia/events/233758436/),
thanks to everyone who came along and the other presenters from
[Make-Create](http://make-create.org/) and to
[Jessica](http://reesby.com.au/) for organizing it all.

Sorry I didn't get to talk to everyone afterwards! The [slides are
up](/iot-aus/) and have a look around elsewhere on this blog, there's
lots of other interesting stuff on there including lots of
[ESP8266](/etc/buzzconf-nights-esp8266-flobot-ciril/) stuff and lots
more to come.
