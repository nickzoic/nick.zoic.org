This is a quick summary of how I turned my
[commuter bike](../the-cycling-bikepacking-post/#commuting-life)
into a touring/bikepacking bike.

## Giant Cross City 1 

The bike is a [Giant Cross City 1 Disc 2018](https://www.giant-bicycles.com/au/cross-city-1-disc-2018)
size Large.

I test rode a few things but I really liked this one: it's not a huge bike and
the standover height is quite low, but it's got good brakes, carbon forks and a
wide range of gears.

## Tyres

It came with 32mm road tyres which were okay but I found them sluggish at low
pressures and squirrelly at high pressures and never found a sweet spot 
between the two.  I replaced them with a set of 40mm Schwalbe Marathon Mondials
(I'd checked the maximum tyre clearance before I bought it)

It's been rather wet around here lately so I'm currently running 40mm Maxxis Ramblers
which aren't quite as easy rolling as the Marathons but a lot more effective
in the mud.

## Bars & Stem

Originally it would have had a 105mm stem length but the dealer changed it over
for a 120mm +6⁰ to add a little room.

That 120mm stem is now flipped to -6⁰ on top of 90mm of
[stem riser](https://sheldonbrown.com/handsup.html) which 
might seem a bit perverse but having the stem negative moves
the bars a little further forward as well.  There's a few mm left
in the stack if I want to got slightly higher or lower.

## Granny Gears
