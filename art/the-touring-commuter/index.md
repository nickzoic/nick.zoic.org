title: The Touring Commuter
summary: Turning a commuter bicycle into a touring machine ...
---

This is a quick summary of how I turned my commuter bike
into a touring/bikepacking bike.

All this stuff is entirely subjective and personal, this is just 
documenting what I did and not what might or might not work for you.

## Giant Cross City 1 

The bike is a [Giant Cross City 1 Disc 2018](https://www.giant-bicycles.com/au/cross-city-1-disc-2018)
size Large.

I test rode a few things but I really liked this one: it's not a huge bike and
the standover height is quite low, but it's got an alloy frame, good brakes,
carbon forks and a wide range of gears.

I [bought it as a commuter](../the-cycling-bikepacking-post/#commuting-life) and
it did a couple of years of that, very slowly getting upgraded as the opportunity
arose ...

## Tyres

The bike came with 32mm road tyres which were okay but I found them sluggish at low
pressures and squirrelly at high pressures and never found a sweet spot 
between the two.  I replaced them with a set of 40mm Schwalbe Marathon Mondials
(I'd checked the maximum tyre clearance before I bought it) which I liked 
a lot better.

It's been rather wet around here lately so I'm currently running 40mm Maxxis Ramblers
which aren't quite as easy rolling as the Marathons but a lot more effective
in the mud.

## Bars & Stem

Originally it would have had a 105mm stem length but the dealer changed it over
for a 120mm +6⁰ to add a little room.  The bars were fairly long and I found my hands
always moved in a little on the grips so I hacksawed a bit off each bar end to make
the whole thing narrower, and liked it like that.  I think I cut it down to about 660mm.

Later I replaced the bars with
[SQlab 310 Sport 2.0](https://www.sq-lab.com/en/area-of-use/trekking/sqlab-handlebar-310-sport-2-0-31-8.html)
bars which have a little more backsweep (16⁰) and a little downsweep (10⁰) and no rise at all.
They're about 680mm wide.

To compensate for the lack of rise, and my aging back, that 120mm stem is now
flipped to -6⁰ on top of 90mm of
[stem riser](https://sheldonbrown.com/handsup.html).  Putting a negative
stem on top of a riser might seem a bit perverse but combined with the head 
tube angle, having the stem negative moves
the bars a little further forward as well.  There's a few mm left
in the stack if I want to got slightly higher or lower.

## Granny Gears

One of the things I really liked about this bike was that it came with
a broad range of gears: a triple 26/36/48 crankset and a 9 speed 11x34 cassette.
The lowest gear, 26:34, is quite low indeed at 21
[gear inches](https://www.sheldonbrown.com/gloss_g.html#gearinch), but I ended up
using it quite a bit, for example on gravel where it's quite nice to be able to spin
up hills even if you're carrying a bunch of stuff.

To that end, when the 11x34 cassette was getting worn out I replaced it with a 11x36,
making that lowest gear about 6% lower, and when the inner crankset gears were starting
to look a bit shonky I replaced the smallest one with a 24 tooth, making those gears
about 7% lower, so now I have a ridiculously low 24:36 (18 gear inches) granny gear.
I don't need it very often but I reckon I use it more than the 48:11 (119 gear inches)
highest gear.
