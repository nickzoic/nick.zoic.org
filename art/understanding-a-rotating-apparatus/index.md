While working on [another project](../saturnalia-a-rotating-christmas-tree/)
I was looking for a way to connect wiring from a stationary base
to a rotating platform.  I knew what I needed was a rotating contact
of some kind, a bit like the
[concentric contacts in the base of fancy electric kettles](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32849830287.html),
but I had no idea what that was called.

It turns out this is called a
[Slip Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slip_ring)
and there are [many applications](https://youtu.be/gisdyTBMNyQ)
and you can just [buy them on ebay](https://www.ebay.com.au/sch/i.html?_nkw=slip+ring+for+robotics&_sop=15) and in the end I improved
my design to only need two low-voltage contacts and just used a 
[1/4" phono plug](https://nick.zoic.org/art/saturnalia-a-rotating-christmas-tree/#slip-ring).

It works well enough for that project, but slip rings are not
100% efficient and they introduce a point where contacts can wear
out and introduce resistance and noise.  There's been a lot of 
work on this over the last couple of centuries for things like
lighthouses and antennas.

In my searching I had happened upon
[US Patent 3,586,413](https://patents.google.com/patent/US3586413A/en),
which seemed to solve the problem without any kind of rotating
contact at all, but I'd skipped over it because it involved gears
and multiple rotation speeds and I couldn't make head or tail of it.

I worked it out eventually and then forgot about it for a few
years.  But every Christmas when I set up that tree I think
I should really write something about this unloved little 
patent, and here it is ...
