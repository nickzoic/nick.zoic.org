summary: 'Part 3 -- now with multiple sprites'
---

PREVIOUSLY: In [Writing an Apple 2 game in 2021 Part 1](/art/writing-an-apple-2-game-in-2021-1/)
I give a bit of an introduction to the Apple 2 platform and discuss how I'm hoping
to proceed and what I'm trying to write.  In [Writing an Apple 2 game in 2021 Part 2](/art/writing-an-apple-2-game-in-2021-2/) I talk a bit about the 6502 and how to draw stuff
on the Lo-Res screen.

In this article, I'm going to get multiple sprites working and introduce the
[open source project](https://github.com/nickzoic/lores-goose-game) and explain
how to run the software.

# Multiple Sprites
