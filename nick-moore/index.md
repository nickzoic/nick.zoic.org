![Nick Moore](img/nick-moore.jpg)

Iâ€™m a [freelance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freelancer#Etymology)
Software Consultant, generally working through my company 
[Mnemote Pty Ltd](https://mnemote.com/).

I mostly work with Open Source technologies and
web services, doing software and systems architecure, business analysis and
software development. 
I prefer to code in Python, but also work in C, JavaScript, SQL and various others.

I've been on "the Internet" since
[1990](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_%28They_Might_Be_Giants_album%29)
when Melbourne University helpfully provided me with
[Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet) access, a room full of warm
[VT320s](https://vt100.net/docs/vt320-uu/chapter2.html) and, eventually,
a degree in Computer Science. Somewhere along the way I learnt a fair
bit about Unix, Free Software and IP networking, which have pretty much
defined my career ever since. One of my proudest career moments was
getting [RFC 4429](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4429) to [Proposed
Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Standard#Proposed_Standard).
I'm also very interested in [Mesh Networking](https://mesh.zoic.org/),
[MicroPython](/tag/micropython) and [programming language design](/tag/languages)
especially in [education](/tag/education).

I live in the suburbs of Melbourne, Australia with my wife, two
daughters, a very enthusiastic dog and a very vocal cat.

I've been very active on [Twitter: @nickzoic](https://twitter.com/nickzoic/)
and [Twitter: @mnemote](https://twitter.com/mnemote/)
over the years but given the state of the place at the moment I'm taking a step
back from it.

I'm not active on any of the other social media services at this time
and haven't bothered to sign up to every one of them just to reserve my usual
name, so if you see me there, it ain't me.  Feel free to drop me
an email if you think someone is impersonating me on one of those.
