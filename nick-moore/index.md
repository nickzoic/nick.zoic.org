Iâ€™m a [freelance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freelancer#Etymology)
Software Consultant, generally working through my company 
[Mnemote Pty Ltd](https://mnemote.com/).

I mostly work with Open Source technologies and
web services, doing software and systems architecure, business analysis and
software development. 
I prefer to code in Python, but also work in C, JavaScript, SQL and various others.

I've been on "the Internet" since
[1990](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_%28They_Might_Be_Giants_album%29)
when Melbourne University helpfully provided me with
[Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet) access, a room full of warm
[VT320s](http://vt100.net/docs/vt320-uu/chapter2.html) and, eventually,
a degree in Computer Science. Somewhere along the way I learnt a fair
bit about Unix, Free Software and IP networking, which have pretty much
defined my career ever since. One of my proudest career moments was
getting [RFC 4429](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4429) to [Proposed
Standard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Standard#Proposed_Standard).
I'm also very interested in [Mesh Networking](https://mesh.zoic.org/),
[MicroPython](/tag/micropython) and [programming language design](/tag/languages)
especially in [education](/tag/education).

I live in the suburbs of Melbourne, Australia with my wife, two
daughters, a very enthusiastic dog and a very vocal cat.
Also some
