Iâ€™m a [freelance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freelancer#Etymology)
Software Consultant, mostly working with Open Source technologies and
web services. A lot of my work these days is in business analysis:
working out what the problem actually is, as opposed to what it seems to
be. I prefer to code in Python, but also work in Perl,
C/C\#/Objective-C, SQL and (for my sins) JavaScript.

I've been on "the Internet" since
[1990](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_%28They_Might_Be_Giants_album%29)
when Melbourne University helpfully provided me with
[Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet) access, a room full of warm
[VT320s](http://vt100.net/docs/vt320-uu/chapter2.html) and, eventually,
a degree in Computer Science. Somewhere along the way I learnt a fair
bit about Unix, Free Software and IP networking, which have pretty much
defined my career ever since. One of my proudest career moments was
getting [RFC 4429](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4429) to [Proposed
Standard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Standard#Proposed_Standard).
I'm also very interested in [Mesh Networking](http://mesh.zoic.org/).

I live in the suburbs of Melbourne, Australia with my wife, two
daughters, a very antisocial
[cat](http://zoic.smugmug.com/Family/Wally-the-Cat-1/i-Kwx4b72/0/L/IMG_3720-L.jpg)
and a very enthusiastic dog. Also some fish and
