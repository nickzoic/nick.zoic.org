From time to time in conversation I mention stuff on the web I've
found particularly thought provoking --
sometimes I remember to follow up with a URL, sometimes I forget.

So this is an attempt to round all those links up into one place
with an easy to write URL ...

(updated whenever I think of something)

### Simplicity in Programming

Some time around the dawn of computing, [Chuck Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_H._Moore)
developed the [Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth), a language so radically
simple it's hard to be sure it's even real.  He used Forth to develop some
[VLSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Large_Scale_Integration) design tools 
for creating microprocessors.  Normal VLSI tools are incredibly complicated and
expensive, and can be used to design sophisticted CPUs like the Intel and ARM 
devices we're used to.

Chuck's Forth VLSI tools are too limited to be used to design a sophisticated CPU,
but Forth doesn't want or need those features anyway.  If a CPU is capable of
running the design tools which designed it, isn't that enough?

From [My history with Forth & stack machines](https://yosefk.com/blog/my-history-with-forth-stack-machines.html):
>
> To me, VLSI tools in 500 lines [of Forth] qualify as a superpower [...]
> I showed Chuck Moore's description of [his VLSI tools] to an ASIC hacker.
> He said it was very simplistic â€“ no way you could do with that what people
> are doing with standard tools.
>
> But Chuck Moore isn't doing that, under the assumption that you need not to.

Simplicity begets simplicity, if you let it.
What complexity are you introducing just to support other complexity?
