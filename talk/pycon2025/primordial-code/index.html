	  This is a computer.
     </p><p>
	  It's really just a box which holds a bunch of parts
	  together with brackets and prevents the insides getting
	  lost or outside stuff getting in.
     </p><p>
	  There's a bunch of ports on the outside to let
	  power and signals in and out, they have specific
	  purposes and shapes.
     </p><p>
	  This is a central processing unit which executes
	  programs which tells the whole thing what to do.
     </p><p>
          Around it are a bunch of peripherals which support 
	  those programs and interface between them and the world.
	  Some of those have their own little processors.
     </p><p>
          Computers like this are pretty generic things, but can adapt 
	  to many different tasks depending on the situation they
	  find themselves in and the programs they're running.

		... this is a cell.
	</p><p>
	There's a <em>cell membrane</em>, which stops molecules just
	floating in or out, and inside is a thing called the <em>cytoplasm</em>
		which holds everything in place and connects it together.
     </p><p>
     The cell membrane has a bunch of <em>channels</em> which 
		transport specific types of molecule in and out of the cell.
     </p><p>
     This is the <em>nucleus</em> which uses instructions encoded in <em>chromosomes</em>.
     </p><p>
     Around it are a bunch of periperal <em>organelles</em> which have specific interfacing
     jobs to do.
     </p><p>
     Lastly: cells start off <em>pluripotent</em> and specialize into their roles.

    <p>About 4.5 billion years ago the Earth formed, which made a lot of people angry.</p>
    <p>Once things settled down a bit, there was a sea, and a bunch of molecules.</p>
    <p>Some molecules worked out how to make copies of themselves.</p>
    
    <p>About 4 billion years ago, cell walls happened,

    <p>There's a lot we still don't know about cell biology. The
    mechanisms by which all living things function and reproduce
    are complex and difficult to observe directly, since they are
    hidden inside living cells.</p>
    <p>But we can construct experiments which let us observe the
    outward behaviour of cells and through analysis we can
    determine what's going on inside them. This is not totally
    unlike black-box testing of software: you might not be able to
    read the code, but if you can find a correlation between a
    change in input and a change in output, you can start to
    understand what the program does even if you can't directly
    watch it doing it.</p>

    <p>The "program" of a cell is called its genome. The human
    genome is split into 23 chromosomes each of which is a DNA
    molecule, a chain of a hundred million or so little building
    blocks called base pairs or nucleotides. All in all, the human
    genome consists of about 12Gbit of information.</p>
    <p>All of your cells have the same genome, like sharing a
    container image, but different genes are active in different

    <p>We do know a bit about the syntax. Each chromosome contains
    many regions called genes, with each gene providing the
    instructions to make tiny blobby machines called proteins,
    which the cell uses to do its job. Each gene is wrapped up in
    more instructions which form a kind of header and footer and
    which regulate how and when the gene is used. Some genes are
    small, hundreds of base pairs long and producing a single
    protein and some are very large, a couple of million base pairs
    and encoding dozens of proteins.</p>
