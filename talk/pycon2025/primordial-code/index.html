     You, by which I mean all the Eukaryotes in the audience,
     are running on an operating system a couple of billion years old
     which is full of primordial libraries, monkey patches, self-modifying
     code, viral hacks and even containers running a different operating system.
   </p><p>
     This talk is all about the freakish parallels between cell biology and
     computer architecture, and will leave you less confident than ever that
     your seemingly complex life is anything more than a molecule's way of
     making more molecules.

	  We'll mostly be talking about Eukaryotes because we like to think
	  that we're the most advanced form of life, but let's not get too 
	  arrogant because Eukaryota also includes fungi, plants, algae,
	  yeasts and slime molds.

	  Examples include:

    genomes as shared container images with run-time specialization.
    instruction/bytecode decoding as protein transcription
    non-coding DNA as:

    dead code (pseudogenes)
    transformation of code by other code (RNA interactions)

    <p>There's a lot we still don't know about cell biology. The
    mechanisms by which all living things function and reproduce
    are complex and difficult to observe directly, since they are
    hidden inside living cells.</p>
    <p>But we can construct experiments which let us observe the
    outward behaviour of cells and through analysis we can
    determine what's going on inside them. This is not totally
    unlike black-box testing of software: you might not be able to
    read the code, but if you can find a correlation between a
    change in input and a change in output, you can start to
    understand what the program does even if you can't directly
    watch it doing it.</p>

    <p>The "program" of a cell is called its genome. The human
    genome is split into 23 chromosomes each of which is a DNA
    molecule, a chain of a hundred million or so little building
    blocks called base pairs or nucleotides. All in all, the human
    genome consists of about 12Gbit of information.</p>
    <p>All of your cells have the same genome, like sharing a
    container image, but different genes are active in different
    cells, depending on their role in the body.</p>

    <p>We do know a bit about the syntax. Each chromosome contains
    many regions called genes, with each gene providing the
    instructions to make tiny blobby machines called proteins,
    which the cell uses to do its job. Each gene is wrapped up in
    more instructions which form a kind of header and footer and
    which regulate how and when the gene is used. Some genes are
    small, hundreds of base pairs long and producing a single
    protein and some are very large, a couple of million base pairs
    and encoding dozens of proteins.</p>
